The porous cavity is fully described by a mesh file with triangular cells on the part’s mid-surface and cell set definitions. The latter can be used for specifying the location of the pressure injection ports and regions with different preforms by assigning different thickness, porosity and permeability values. Additional equations (e.g. for modeling the degree-of-cure) can either be added with equations of the same type or modifications of existing equations (e.g. for variable cavity thickness as needed for vacuum assisted resin infusion simulations).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Package-Features","page":"Home","title":"Package Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The simulation model shall give correct results for filling pattern and filling time.\nThe simulation tool takes only composite-manufacturing related inputs and the simulation shall be robust independent of numerics-related input.\nThe simulation tool takes a shell model of the geometry as input and the location-dependent properties are assigned directly on the shell elements.\nNew functionalities can be implemented by either adding equations of the same type or modifying existing equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Function-Documentation","page":"Home","title":"Function Documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"rtmsim.plot_mesh(meshfilename,i_mode)","category":"page"},{"location":"#rtmsim.plot_mesh-Tuple{Any, Any}","page":"Home","title":"rtmsim.plot_mesh","text":"function plot_mesh(meshfilename,i_mode)\n\nCreate mesh plot with cells with i_mode==1 and create mesh plots with cell center nodes with i_mode==2 for manual selection of inlet ports.\n\nUnit test:\n\nrtmsim.plot_mesh(\"..\\meshfiles\\mesh_permeameter1_foursets.bdf\",1)\n\nAdditional unit tests:\n\nrtmsim.plot_mesh(\"..\\meshfiles\\mesh_annulusfiller1.bdf\",2) for the manual selection of inlet ports with left mouse button click while key p is pressed \nrtmsim.rtmsim_rev1(1,\"..\\meshfiles\\mesh_annulusfiller1.bdf\",200, 0.35e5,1.205,1.4,0.06, 0.35e5,0.00e5, 3e-3,0.7,3e-10,1,1,0,0, 3e-3,0.7,3e-10,1,1,0,0, 3e-3,0.7,3e-10,1,1,0,0, 3e-3,0.7,3e-10,1,1,0,0, 3e-3,0.7,3e-10,1,1,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 0,\"results.jld2\",1,0.01,16) for starting only with the interactively selected inlet ports\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"rtmsim.read_nastran_mesh(meshfilename,paramset,paramset1,paramset2,paramset3,paramset4,patchtype1val,patchtype2val,patchtype3val,patchtype4val,i_interactive,r_p)","category":"page"},{"location":"#rtmsim.read_nastran_mesh-NTuple{12, Any}","page":"Home","title":"rtmsim.read_nastran_mesh","text":"function read_nastran_mesh(meshfilename,paramset,paramset1,paramset2,paramset3,paramset4,patchtype1val,patchtype2val,patchtype3val,patchtype4val,i_interactive,r_p)\n\nRead file in Nastran format with fixed length (8 digits), nodes (GRIDS) defined in global coordinate system.\n\nUnit test:\n\nparamset=[0.5,0.3,3e-10,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0];paramset1=paramset;paramset2=paramset;paramset3=paramset;paramset4=paramset;patchtype1val=-1;patchtype2val=-1;patchtype3val=-1;patchtype4val=-1;i_interactive=0;r_p=0.01; N,cellgridid,gridx,gridy,gridz,cellcenterx,cellcentery,cellcenterz,patchparameters,patchparameters1,patchparameters2,patchparameters3,patchparameters4,patchids1,patchids2,patchids3,patchids4,inletpatchids=read_mesh(meshfilename,paramset,paramset1,paramset2,paramset3,paramset4,patchtype1val,patchtype2val,patchtype3val,patchtype4val,i_interactive,r_p)`\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"rtmsim.start_rtmsim(inputfilename)","category":"page"},{"location":"#rtmsim.start_rtmsim-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"rtmsim.start_rtmsim","text":"start_rtmsim(inputfilename)\n\nReads the text input file and calls the solver with the read parameters.
